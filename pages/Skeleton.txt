3. Links to official sources
4. Q&A / follow up questions

The output will be shown in a chat-style answer in plain language, with small tables (if applicable) and source citations.

Data sources:
1. Recursively scrape the CPF website

Flowchart:
1. User opens "Policy Explainer page"
2. User selects optional context inputs (Age and income band)
3. User enters his query.
4. User clicks Ask
5. App combines structured inputs and user query in to an improved query
6. Query is embedded
7. Vector DB performs retireval using similarity search
8. App contstructs LLM prompt containing the user's question, retrieved text chunks and instructions
9. LLM generates output
10. App displays the output
