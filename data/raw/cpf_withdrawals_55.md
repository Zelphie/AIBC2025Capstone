## Overview
From age 55, members can start withdrawing part of their CPF savings. The amount depends on whether they have set aside their required retirement sum and whether they own a property that qualifies for using the Basic Retirement Sum.

## Key withdrawal rules (high level)
- At 55, part of your OA and SA is set aside in the Retirement Account (RA) up to your required sum.
- Members can withdraw a small lump sum even if they have not met the Full Retirement Sum.
- Members who have set aside the required sum may withdraw savings above it, subject to CPF rules.

## Typical scenarios
- **Members who have not met the Full Retirement Sum (FRS)**  
  - Can usually withdraw up to a limited amount (e.g. a fixed basic amount) from 55.
  - Remaining savings are mostly kept in CPF to earn interest and support payouts later.

- **Members who have set aside at least the FRS**  
  - May withdraw savings above the FRS from their OA and SA.
  - Withdrawals will reduce future monthly payouts.

- **Property owners using BRS**  
  - Members who meet criteria (including property lease) can use the Basic Retirement Sum instead of FRS.
  - They may withdraw more cash if their property is pledged and conditions are met.
  - When the property is sold, part of the sale proceeds may need to be refunded to CPF (principal plus accrued interest) to restore retirement savings.

## Daily withdrawal limit and channels
- Online withdrawals for members 55 and above are typically subject to a daily limit to manage security and fraud risk.
- Members can adjust their daily withdrawal limit within CPF’s allowed range.
- Withdrawals can usually be made via online services, selected forms, or other official channels indicated on CPF’s site.

## Interaction with payouts
- Money withdrawn at 55 reduces the amount left in CPF to generate interest and fund CPF LIFE payouts.
- Members who do not need the cash immediately may benefit from leaving savings in CPF to grow.

## Notes
- This summary simplifies CPF’s detailed rules on withdrawals from age 55.
- Actual withdrawal eligibility and amounts depend on your RA balance, property status, and other factors.
- Always refer to CPF’s official tools and services for up-to-date withdrawal options.
