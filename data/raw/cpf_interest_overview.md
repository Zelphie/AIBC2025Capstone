## Overview
CPF pays interest on members’ savings at government-guaranteed rates. In addition to base interest on each account, extra interest is paid on lower balances to help build up retirement savings, especially for older members.

## Base interest (high level)
- Ordinary Account (OA) earns a base interest rate with a long-term floor.
- Special, MediSave and Retirement Accounts (SA, MA, RA) earn a higher base rate with their own floor.
- Interest is typically computed monthly and credited annually.

## Extra interest
- Members below 55 earn an extra interest on the first portion of their combined CPF balances, up to a cap for OA.
- Members 55 and above earn higher extra interest on the first tier of combined balances, and additional extra interest on the next tier.
- Extra interest earned on OA savings is usually directed to SA or RA to further strengthen retirement savings.

## Why this matters
- Extra interest boosts the long-term growth of CPF savings, especially for smaller balances.
- For retirement planning, this means that CPF often provides a relatively stable, risk-free return, but actual returns depend on account composition and policy changes.

## Notes
- CPF announces interest rates for specific quarters and may update them from time to time.
- Always refer to the latest official announcements for current rates and extra interest rules.
