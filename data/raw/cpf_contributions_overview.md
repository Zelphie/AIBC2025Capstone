## Overview
Employees and employers contribute a percentage of monthly wages to CPF. The total contribution rate depends mainly on the employee’s age and wage band, and is shared between employer and employee.

## Key points
- Contribution rates are highest for younger workers and step down gradually with age.
- For Singapore Citizens and SPRs (from the third year onwards), CPF publishes a standard table of rates by age group.
- Policy changes gradually raise contribution rates for older workers to strengthen retirement adequacy.

## Age bands (illustrative description)
- **55 and below** – highest total contribution rate.
- **Above 55 to 60** – slightly lower total rate, with scheduled increases from 2025/2026.
- **Above 60 to 65** – lower total rate, also subject to scheduled increases.
- **Above 65** – lower rates reflecting shorter remaining working horizon.

## Movements between age bands
- When an employee crosses specific birthdate thresholds (e.g. 55, 60, 65, 70), the applicable contribution rate changes.
- The new rate applies from the first day of the month after they enter the new age band.

## Relation to the simulator
- For the prototype, the app may use a simplified mapping from income band and age band to an estimated monthly contribution.
- This estimate is for illustration only and may not match the member’s actual contributions.

## Notes
- For actual payroll calculations, employers must refer to CPF’s official tables and tools.
- This summary is meant only to give users a sense of how contributions support long-term retirement savings.
