## Overview
Members who are 55 and above can withdraw eligible CPF savings through CPF’s online services or designated channels. Withdrawals may be subject to daily limits and require proper verification for security.

## Daily withdrawal limit (overview)
- Online withdrawals are subject to a **default daily limit** (varies depending on CPF's prevailing security policy).
- Members may adjust their daily limit within CPF’s allowed range using online services.
- Limits help safeguard against unauthorised or fraudulent withdrawals.

## Withdrawal channels
### Online application
- Members log in with Singpass.
- Withdrawals can typically be made from OA and SA (subject to age 55 rules), and RA (from the payout eligibility age).
- Funds are disbursed to members’ bank accounts.

### In-person or form-based applications
- Some special withdrawal types may require forms or additional supporting documents.
- Processing time may vary by withdrawal type.

## Typical process flow
1. Log in to CPF online services.  
2. Select the withdrawal type (55 withdrawal, payouts, medical needs, etc.).  
3. Verify bank account details.  
4. Confirm amount (subject to eligibility and limits).  
5. Submit and wait for CPF processing and bank transfer.

## Important conditions
- Withdrawals reduce future RA balances and therefore future CPF LIFE payouts.
- Members should understand how withdrawal choices affect long-term retirement income.
- CPF may ask for additional identity verification depending on transaction risk.

## Notes
- This summary simplifies withdrawal procedures and may not cover all special cases.
- Members must always follow CPF’s official instructions and use verified channels.
