## Overview
CPF allows members (and their loved ones) to top up the Retirement Account (RA) to increase retirement payouts. Top-ups can be made via the Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU) scheme or CPF transfers. These top-ups help members reach higher retirement sums such as the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) or Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS).

## Why people top up
- To enjoy **higher CPF LIFE monthly payouts** in the future.
- To help parents, grandparents, or spouses increase their retirement adequacy.
- To earn risk-free CPF interest rates on long-term savings.
- To utilise spare cash that’s intended for retirement.

## Types of top-ups
### Cash top-ups (RSTU)
- Anyone can top up their own RA.
- You can also top up your parents’, grandparents’, spouse’s or siblings’ CPF accounts.
- Cash top-ups typically count towards tax relief (subject to prevailing caps and rules).

### CPF transfers
- Members can transfer savings from SA or OA to RA (the member’s own RA only).
- Transfers earn the higher interest rate applicable to RA.
- Transfers are **not** eligible for tax relief.

## How much can be topped up
- Members can top up up to the **Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS)**.
- ERS is typically around three times the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS).  
  (Exact amounts are cohort-based and set at age 55.)

## Impact on retirement payouts
- Top-ups directly increase the RA balance.
- Higher RA balances result in **higher CPF LIFE monthly payouts**.
- Top-ups help close the gap for members who are below BRS/FRS.

## Notes
- Top-ups are **non-refundable** except under special limited circumstances.
- Tax rules and eligibility for relief can change; members should check the latest CPF guidance.
