## Overview
Members can choose when to begin receiving monthly CPF LIFE payouts, within the payout start age range set by CPF. Deferring payouts can increase monthly payout amounts.

## Payout start age (high level)
- Most members begin receiving payouts at the **standard payout age**.
- Members may choose to defer payouts up to a maximum age set by CPF.

## Why defer payouts?
- Delaying payouts allows RA savings more time to grow.
- Monthly payouts will be higher when started later.
- Members with other income sources early in retirement may prefer to defer.

## Relation to the simulator
- Members who seem below FRS may benefit from considering a later payout age.
- Simulator explanations may highlight the effect of extra interest over a longer accumulation period.

## Notes
- Differences in payout amounts depend on CPF LIFE actuarial calculations.
- Members should always check with the official CPF payout estimator for exact numbers.
