## Overview
Property ownership can affect how much CPF members must set aside for retirement. In particular, members who own a home with sufficient remaining lease may be allowed to use the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) instead of the Full Retirement Sum (FRS) at age 55.

## Key points
- Members who own a property with a lease long enough to last them until age 95 may rely on BRS.
- If the lease does not meet requirements, members may have to meet FRS instead.
- Members can “pledge” their property when forming their Retirement Account (RA), allowing partial withdrawal above the BRS.

## Property pledge
- A portion of the property’s value may be pledged to CPF when withdrawing beyond BRS.
- If the property is later sold, the pledged amount (plus accrued interest) must be returned to CPF up to the amount withdrawn.

## Impact on withdrawals at 55
- Property owners who meet conditions can withdraw more at 55, depending on their RA formation amount.
- Non-property owners must generally meet FRS before withdrawing amounts above the basic threshold.

## Notes
- Property rules interact with CPF retirement rules in complex ways.
- Members should refer to CPF housing pages and specific calculators for details.
