## Overview
CPF LIFE is Singapore’s national longevity insurance scheme. It provides monthly payouts for as long as a member lives, funded by savings in their Retirement Account and government-guaranteed interest.

## Key features
- Lifelong monthly payouts starting from a chosen payout age within CPF’s allowed range.
- Payouts continue even after the original RA savings are exhausted.
- Any unused CPF LIFE premium balance, together with remaining CPF savings, will be paid to beneficiaries when the member passes away.

## CPF LIFE plans (high level)
- **Standard Plan** – relatively higher payouts at the start and stable levels over time.
- **Escalating Plan** – lower payouts initially that gradually increase each year, helping offset inflation.
- **Basic / other variants** – may have different payout patterns or premium balances.


## How payouts are determined (simplified)
- Size of your Retirement Account savings used to join CPF LIFE.
- Choice of plan and payout start age.
- CPF interest rates, including extra interest paid on lower balances.
- Mortality and longevity assumptions used by CPF’s actuaries.

CPF provides payout ranges for different retirement sum levels and age cohorts in its examples, and offers calculators to estimate payouts more precisely.

## Official tools
- **Monthly Payout Estimator** – lets you estimate payouts based on savings and chosen payout age.
- Other planners and calculators may be available for members below 55 or those already on a plan.

## Notes
- This summary is for educational use; it omits many actuarial and policy details.
- Members should use CPF’s official estimators and planning tools for individual calculations.
