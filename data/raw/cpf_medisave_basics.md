## Overview
MediSave is a key part of the CPF system that helps members save for healthcare needs. Members can use MediSave to pay for approved medical expenses, insurance premiums, and selected outpatient treatments.

## What MediSave can be used for
- Hospitalisation and day surgery.
- Selected outpatient treatments.
- Approved chronic disease management programmes.
- Certain health screenings and vaccinations.

## Limits
- Withdrawals are subject to MediSave withdrawal limits (per bill, per item, or per year).
- Limits ensure members continue to have adequate healthcare savings over time.

## Relation to retirement
- Though not directly part of retirement income, MediSave reduces the burden of medical expenses in older age.
- Understanding MediSave helps users make sense of how CPF accounts serve different needs.

## Notes
- MediSave rules can be updated; users must refer to official CPF pages for exact limits.
