## Overview
CPF sets three benchmark retirement sums – Basic (BRS), Full (FRS) and Enhanced (ERS) – to indicate how much savings a member should set aside at age 55 to receive different levels of monthly payouts in retirement.

## Key definitions
- **BRS**: Baseline amount that aims to cover basic living expenses in retirement, assuming the member owns a property with sufficient lease.
- **FRS**: Standard benchmark (about twice BRS) for members who do not rely on property to support their retirement income.
- **ERS**: Higher benchmark (historically around three times BRS; from 2025 it may be raised further) for members who want higher payouts and can afford to set aside more.

## Cohort-based sums
- The retirement sums are set based on the year a member turns 55.
- Once your cohort's sum is set, it does not change for that member.
- CPF publishes tables showing BRS, FRS and ERS for recent cohorts.

## How the sums are used
- At age 55, OA and SA savings are combined into the Retirement Account (RA).
- Members are expected to set aside at least the BRS or FRS, depending on property ownership and lease conditions.
- Savings above the required sum may be withdrawn in cash, subject to CPF rules.

## Relationship to CPF LIFE and payouts
- Retirement sums give an indication of the monthly payout range members might receive under CPF LIFE.
- Actual payouts depend on the member's exact RA balance, payout age, and chosen CPF LIFE plan.
- Members should use official CPF calculators to estimate payouts for their own situation.

## Notes
- This document summarises CPF's explanation of BRS, FRS and ERS as of 2025.
- Exact dollar values and policies are updated periodically by CPF.
